CodeSkulptor is an awesome online tool built by Scott Rixner for teaching a Python course at Rice university.
You can easily write and debug Python code on codeskulptor.org but trying to share your games with friends and family members can sometimes be a little painful.  (finding and clicking the run button in the upper left hand corner is a barrier to entry for my mom at least)

This is why I built EmbedSkulptor.  embedskulptor.js makes it easy to put your python programs built using codeskulptor on your own website (simplegui and all).

Here is a working demo of the included simplegui Hello World found in index.html:

http://davealger.com/apps/embedskulptor/

As you can see there are 3 embedded components:
(1) code - this is invisible by default but when shown you can paste your code from codeskulptor.org here and it will run as soon as you click outside of the component
(2) gui - this is the frame created by simplegui.create_frame and is visible by default
(3) console - this is where print statements and other console output goes and is invisible by default

Only the gui is shown by default because the main use case I wanted to cover was someone clicking on a link and my simplegui python game would just start playing like the following stopwatch sample...

Until I can come up with better documentation you'll need to look at the index.html file included with EmbedSkulptor to see how it works.

Thanks for playing with me,
run-time
