CodeSkulptor is an awesome online tool built by Scott Rixner for teaching Python
at RICE university.

You can easily write and debug Python code on http://codeskulptor.org using a
simplegui import module and when it comes time to share your creation with others
you can send a direct link to your CodeSkulptor program and explain how to run
it while keeping the spawning browser tab active along with the pop-up window
it's running in but that can be a little painful for some people.  Finding and
clicking the run button was a barrier to entry for my mom at least...

This is why I created EmbedSkulptor.

EmbedSkulptor makes it easy to share all your simplegui creations on your own
website where they automatically run when the page loads.

Here's a working demo of the included simplegui Hello World:
http://davealger.com/apps/embedskulptor/

As you can see there are 3 embedded components:

(1) code - (hidden by default)
    shows the python code that is running if you choose to show it

(2) gui - (visible by default)
    this is the frame created by simplegui.create_frame

(3) console - (hidden by default)
    this is where print statements and other console output goes

The main use case is to show the simplegui frame and nothing else so the other
components need to be explicitly set to true like in the last example.

Thanks for playing with me,
run-time
